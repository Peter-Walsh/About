# About

### Hello World!
My name's Peter, and I'm a junior at Stony Brook University, working my way towards my B.S. in Computer Science! 

My first ever contact with CS as a field of study was during the first semester of my undergrad at Stony Brook. During my first semester, I enrolled in an introductory programming course to satisfy a general education requirement. Much to my surprise, it inspired me to take another CS course the following semester, and before I knew it, I was a computer science major. When I started my undergrad, my intention was never to pursue a degree in computer science, but now that I am, I couldn't see myself studying anything else.

### What is this place

Programming and developing software is both my field of study and one of my favorite passtimes. I love finding new ways to build things and exploring different technologies, and over the course of my education at Stony Brook I have constructed many of my own toy projects.
