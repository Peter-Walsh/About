# About-me

### Hello World!
My name's Peter, and I'm a rising junior at Stony Brook University, working my way towards my B.S. in Computer Science! 

My first ever contact with CS as a field of study was during the first semester of my undergrad at Stony Brook. During my first semester, I enrolled in an introductory programming course to satisfy a general education requirement. Much to my surprise, it inspired me to take another CS course the following semester, and before I knew it, I was a computer science major. At first, CS was far from my intended direction, but now that I'm here, I couldn't imagine doing anything else!

### What am I up to

This past summer, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for an introductory computer science course (Computer Science Principles/CSE-101), and I'm looking forward to continuing my TAship in person this fall. I'm also in the process of earning IBM's professional certificate in Data Science. 

This fall, I'm going to be looking for internships for the Spring and Summer of 2022. My interests are in artificial intelligence/machine learning, data science, NLP, and computer vision. I'd also like to dabble in web and mobile development at some point. 

### What is this place

The reason I gravitate toward computer science is, simply put, because I like to build stuff. Throughout my undergrad, I've spent a great deal of time building toy projects that both incorporate ideas from my coursework, as well as new technologies I haven't officially covered yet. These toy projects needed a better place to live than on my local machine, and GitHub was the perfect place. Table of contents for my other repositories coming soon...
