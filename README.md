# About

### Hello World!
My name's Peter, and I'm a junior studying computer science at Stony Brook University! If you're really interested in my story, and how I ended up at Stony Brook as a CS major, well check [this]() out.

### What is this place

The reason I got into software development and computer science to begin with is because I like to build stuff. I love finding new ways to build things and exploring different technologies. Over the course of my education at Stony Brook I have constructed many of my own toy projects to reinforce what I've been studying in my coursework and explore new technologies. This Github profile is where I like to show off my side projects.
