# About

### Hello World!
My name's Peter, and I'm a junior studying computer science at Stony Brook University! 

### A long, long time ago in a galaxy, not so far away...
Alright so, if you're not interested in me or how I ended up, well, where I am. You can skip this section. But if you're interested in how I ended up as CS major at Stony Brook my story and my journey thoughout my education, well I'm going to try and lay it all out right here.


How I ended up majoring in CS at Stony Brook is kind of a long story. When I first came to Stony Brook, I was an undecided major. I didn't know what I was doing with my life. In many ways, I still don't, but that's getting off topic. During my first semester at Stony Brook I enrolled in an intro programming/computer science course to satisfy one of my general education requirements. I had never taken any computer science coursework before so I really had no idea what I was walking into. At first, I was terrified. I had no idea how to code, and learning the basics of how to code, even in Python, was a nightmare at first. But I survived, and in the ended up loving the class. So much so that I kept taking CS coursework at Stony Brook until I wound up in the CS major. Now I'm back in that same intro course I took when I was a freshman, except, now I'm one of the teaching assitants. 

### What is this place

The reason I got into software development and computer science to begin with is because I like to build stuff. I love finding new ways to build things and exploring different technologies. Over the course of my education at Stony Brook I have constructed many of my own toy projects to reinforce what I've been studying in my coursework and explore new technologies. This Github profile is where I like to show off my side projects.
