# Table of Contents
This is going to be the table of contents for all of my public repositories. How I will arrange them, I'm not sure yet. I will probably go off of the type of project it was and the programming language. 

I'll probably include a link to each repository with a brief description. For most of my projects, there should be a readme that describes the project in detail so I think I want to make sure I keep the description brief here. 

Everything down below are just placeholders, don't take them too seriously.
