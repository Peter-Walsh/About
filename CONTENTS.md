# Table of Contents
Welcome to the table of contents for all of my projects! 

All of the links to the projects here are just links to my other repositories on this account, so you can find them there. I figured this might be an easier way for people to look at the things I've been working on though.

Please note, there are a few placeholder projects in here (they don't have links).
